## Schematic for Fullstack Fruit Analysis

Below is a schematic for my fullstack challenge assignment.

### Stack
- Streamlit
- Python API for calculations
- NO SPECIFIC PLOTTER for grapghs
- SQLite

### Frontend info
- Visualize the dataset in a way that makes relationships and patterns clear:
 - scatterplots, time-series charts, heatmaps, dashboards. 

### Backend info
- Pandas for easy to use data
- Some machine learning framwork to create an oracle to predict future values for each fruit. There should be a connection where some days the fruits value is 0 and i am looking to find some sort of pattern for when that is.


# Grapghs and information to show
- All graphs, charts and dashboards should be filterable by FRUIT 
- The ability to compare two fruits to eachother. I.E. Show their data on same grapghs
